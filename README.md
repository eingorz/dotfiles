# Hi!
These are the dotfiles for my currrent rice.

![alt text](https://i.redd.it/jfqz5h0w2e0a1.png)

## What do I use?
* Window manager - DWM
* Terminal - Kitty
* Font - SF Pro Rounded & Jetbrains Nerd Font for Icons
* Notifications - Dunst
* CLI Apps - Cava & pfetch
* compositors - picom-jonaburg-git
* [Pape](https://imgur.com/hjy5gJ4)

## Prequisities before you use this
* Install SF Pro & Jet Brains Nerd font fonts
* Install cava
* Install pfetch
* Install the picom jonaburg fork
* **IMPORTANT** Change the tag bindings in DWM's config.h, I'm czech and thus I use the czech qwertz which has a modified number row

## P. S.
The slstatus config is missing because I haven't uploaded it here when I set it up and I have since switched window managers. Sorry. Should be easy to recreate if you plan to use this config though!
